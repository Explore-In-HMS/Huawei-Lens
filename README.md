# Getting Started
Huawei Lens uses HUAWEI services. In order to use them, you have to [create an app](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/distribution/app/agc-create_app) first. Before getting started, please [sign-up](https://id1.cloud.huawei.com/CAS/portal/userRegister/regbyemail.html?service=https%3A%2F%2Foauth-login1.cloud.huawei.com%2Foauth2%2Fv2%2Flogin%3Faccess_type%3Doffline%26client_id%3D6099200%26display%3Dpage%26flowID%3D6d751ab7-28c0-403c-a7a8-6fc07681a45d%26h%3D1603370512.3540%26lang%3Den-us%26redirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fdeveloper.huawei.com%252Fconsumer%252Fen%252Flogin%252Fhtml%252FhandleLogin.html%26response_type%3Dcode%26scope%3Dopenid%2Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.huawei.com%252Fauth%252Faccount%252Fcountry%2Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.huawei.com%252Fauth%252Faccount%252Fbase.profile%26v%3D9f7b3af3ae56ae58c5cb23a5c1ff5af7d91720cea9a897be58cff23593e8c1ed&loginUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fid1.cloud.huawei.com%3A443%2FCAS%2Fportal%2FloginAuth.html&clientID=6099200&lang=en-us&display=page&loginChannel=89000060&reqClientType=89) for a HUAWEI developer account.
After creating the application, you need to [generate a signing certificate fingerprint](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/codelab/HMSPreparation/index.html#3). Then you have to set this fingerprint to the application you created in AppGallery Connect.
- Go to "My Projects" in AppGallery Connect.
- Find your project from the project list and click the app on the project card.
- On the Project Setting page, set SHA-256 certificate fingerprint to the SHA-256 fingerprint you've generated.
